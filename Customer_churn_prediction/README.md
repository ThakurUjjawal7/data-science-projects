# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

📖 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service based on historical customer data. Early identification of churn helps businesses take preventive actions and improve customer retention.

🛠 Model Used
- Logistic Regression  
- The model was chosen because it is well-suited for binary classification problems like churn prediction.

---

📂 Dataset Description
- The dataset contains customer-related information such as:
  - Customer demographics
  - Service usage details
  - Account and billing information
- Target variable:
  - **Churn** (Yes / No)

---

🔍 Approach
1. Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
2. Cleaned the data and handled missing values
3. Converted categorical variables into numerical form
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Trained a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy score

---

📊 Accuracy
- **Model Accuracy:** ~78%

---

📈 Results
- The model successfully identifies customers likely to churn
- Predictions can help businesses focus on high-risk customers and reduce churn rate
