# USA House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices in the USA using machine learning techniques. 
The objective is to analyze housing-related features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, 
square footage, crime rate, and school ratings, and build a regression model to estimate house prices.

🔍 Steps Performed

1. Data Loading
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Checked data shape and structure

2. Data Exploration
- Used `.info()` and `.describe()` to understand data
- Checked missing values
- Analyzed distributions of numerical features
- Visualized house price distribution using histograms

3. Feature Analysis
- Studied relationships between numerical features and house price
- Identified important predictors influencing price

4. Model Building
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Implemented **Linear Regression** model
- Trained the model on training data

5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated performance on test data
- Compared actual vs predicted house prices
- Analyzed model accuracy and errors

---
📊 Results
- The regression model was able to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy
- Feature relationships such as square footage, number of rooms, and location-related factors
  showed strong influence on pricing

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a machine learning regression problem,
from data exploration to model training and evaluation. It highlights how structured data
can be used to build predictive models for real-world business problems like real estate pricing.
