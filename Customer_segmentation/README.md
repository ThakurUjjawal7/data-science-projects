# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

📖 Problem Statement
Businesses often have diverse customers with different purchasing behaviors.
The objective of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups
based on their behavior so that businesses can apply targeted marketing and
improve customer engagement.

---

🛠 Model Used
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Means was chosen because it is a simple and effective unsupervised learning
  algorithm for grouping similar data points into clusters.

---

📂 Dataset Description
- Customer dataset containing features related to purchasing behavior
- Features include spending patterns and customer-related attributes
- No target variable (unsupervised learning)

---

🔍 Approach
1. Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
2. Selected relevant numerical features for clustering
3. Scaled features to ensure equal contribution in distance calculation
4. Applied K-Means clustering algorithm
5. Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
6. Assigned cluster labels to each customer
7. Visualized clusters for interpretation

---

📊 Results
- Customers were successfully grouped into distinct segments
- Each cluster represents customers with similar purchasing behavior
- The segmentation can help businesses design targeted strategies
  for different customer groups

---

📚 What I Learned
- Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Importance of feature scaling in distance-based algorithms
- How K-Means clustering works internally
- Selecting optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
- Interpreting clusters for business understanding

---

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used to
identify meaningful customer segments from raw data. It highlights
the practical use of clustering techniques for business and marketing
applications.
